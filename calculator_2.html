# Prompt: Build an Interactive ROI Calculator for Partipost Marketing Campaign Comparison

Create an interactive HTML calculator that compares the ROI between two marketing strategies with the same total monthly budget:

## Strategy A: Traditional Monthly Advertising
- Runs traditional ads every month
- Consistent monthly spend
- Direct conversion tracking

## Strategy B: Nano Creator + Retargeting Campaign
- Runs nano creator campaigns every other month (bi-monthly)
- Uses remaining budget for retargeting ads in off-months
- Leverages creator-generated content for retargeting
